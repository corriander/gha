name: Publish the project with poetry
description: |
  The project will be built with the PEP440 equivalent of the version number,
  dist/* added to the release and ultimately published to a package feed.

inputs:
  python-version:
    description: Python version to use for the virtual environment
    required: true

  poetry-version:
    description: Poetry version to use for orchestrating the tests
    required: true

  release-tag:
    description: |
      Project version tag the release was published against.

      Note that even though this is a python project, the version tag could be 
      SemVer rather than PEP440. The package will be built against the PEP440
      translation.

      The version number is likely to be prefixed with 'v'
